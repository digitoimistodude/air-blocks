Project start scripts have been refactored completely.
See [pull request #11](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/dudestack/pull/11).

### Changes:

- Deprecated docker and vagrant - they are horribly outdated and we can't support them no longer. [dudestack-docker](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/dudestack-docker) has been retired.
- Add working WSL support ([documentation](https://rolle.design/local-server-on-windows-10-for-wordpress-theme-development)), linked also to [windows-lemp-setup](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/windows-lemp-setup)
- Modularize bash scripts, add files as partials. From now on we need to edit files under bin/tasks and no need to touch main files macos.sh and wsl.sh
- Beautiful formatting and instructions to start script
- Prevent running directly with bash or sh to prevent possible issues with them
- Variable all the things - no need to search and replace stuff
- Fix typos
- Fix WP-CLI commands, there were couple of issues with it
- Fix cleanups - we had wp-cli.yml credentials left saved to project - oops!
- Add some checks (is git found, are certs created, is mkcert found etc.)
- Add extra notifications that these scripts need dudestack and dev servers to work
- Move everything to .env_createproject in $HOME. No more setup.sh or complicated generate scripts, everything should work directly from dudestack repo WITH updates in the future
