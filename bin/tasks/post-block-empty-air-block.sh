# Tasks after functions.php has been updated

# Let's go to the project directory
cd ${PROJECTS_HOME}/${PROJECT_NAME}

# Remove the file without any changes
# rm ${PROJECT_THEME_PATH}/functions.php

# Rename the changed file to the official one
#mv ${PROJECT_THEME_PATH}/tmpfile ${PROJECT_THEME_PATH}/functions.php
